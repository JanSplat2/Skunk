The Skunk application is developed using SwiftUI and optimized for the iPad, providing an interactive and engaging multiplayer dice game experience.
The interface features four distinct players, each represented by a unique pair of colored dice positioned in the corners of the screen, with a clear indicator showing the current player’s turn.
Players take turns to roll or pass the dice, with game logic following traditional Skunk rules — rolling one “skunk” forfeits the round’s points, while rolling two “skunks” resets the player’s total score to zero.
The system automatically tracks and updates scores, and once a player reaches 100 points, the game concludes by displaying the winning player in a clear, celebratory manner.
